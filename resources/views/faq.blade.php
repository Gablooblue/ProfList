		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>What makes this site different?</h3>
		<p>Other professor rating sites use a 5-star system or a 10-point system to rate their professors. I found that inaccurate because people will normally choose a random number in the middle. So I changed it to use a like or dislike system to produce a more realistic score</p>
		<h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
		<p> I was bored and had some free time</p>
		<h3>Why is it called Sophists?</h3>
		<p>Long ago, during the time of Socrates, there were these philosophers called "Sophists". These Sophists spewed incorrect information and were later disproved by Socrates and Aristotle. Similarly, I want todays students to be able to rate their professors to know if they were any good.
		<h3>Technologies used?</h3>
		<p>I used PHP with a Laravel framework along with a Bootstrap frontend to create the site</p>
